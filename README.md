# MedSimplifieD
MedSimplifieD is a hackathon project submission for iNTUition 2023.

In response to MSD's problem, our team decided to create a web-app to help medical professionals summarize important medical research articles. The web-app would allow users to upload their own PDF documents. The documents would be then turned into text (.txt) form before it is shortened via the GPT-3 chatbot. Following the summary, users can choose if they want to turn the article's important points into slides, or if they wish to ask other related qns. The qns would be answered by a chatbot 'RASA' which was trained in interaction betwwen humans

## Installation
Users can install the RASA project via pip install python followed by rasa init. The rest of the code can be downloaded friom the github repository.

## Credits
use of external libraries such as pikepdf, canoepy and others had to be involved.
