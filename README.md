# MedSimplifieD by in-to-yishun
MedSimplifieD is a hackathon project submission for iNTUition 2023.

In response to MSD's problem, our team decided to create a web-app to help medical professionals summarize important medical research articles. The web-app would allow users to upload their own PDF documents. The documents would be then turned into text (.txt) form before it is shortened via the GPT-3 chatbot. Following the summary, users can choose if they want to turn the article's important points into slides, or if they wish to ask other related qns. The qns would be answered by a chatbot 'RASA' which was trained in interaction between humans
